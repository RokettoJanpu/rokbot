RokettoJanpu's Nightbot Command Pack:


NOTES:
1. You MUST have Nightbot join your channel before you attempt to use or create any custom cmds*! Click here, then click the "Join Channel" button. Afterwards, you must mod Nightbot in your channel by typing /mod Nightbot in your channel chat.


2. All custom APIs used with any of the $(urlfetch) cmd variables are derived from here.


3. All alias cmds perform the same function as the specified "parent" cmd. Names of alias cmds written below are usually abbreviations of their parent cmd names for easy reference, but they are NOT required.


4. New cmds may NOT shares names with pre-existing ones. If a cmd below shares a name with one you already have, just rename the new cmd's name to something you don't already have.


*Cmd - I often say this in place of the word command


Instruction: To add any of the cmds below, copy and paste an !addcom line, which includes the cmd name and its syntax, and paste it into your Twitch chat.
